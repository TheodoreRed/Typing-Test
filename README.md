## Code Overview

The Typing Test is a web-based application that provides users with random sentences to type. The game lasts for 60 seconds, and the goal is to type as many sentences as possible with the highest accuracy. After 60 seconds, the game will display the number of words typed correctly and the number of mistakes made.

### Key Features:
- **Random Sentences**: Sentences are shuffled and presented to the user one by one.
- **Real-time Feedback**: As the user types, the input changes color to indicate correctness.
- **60 Second Timer**: Users have a limited time to type as many sentences as they can.
- **Dynamic UI**: Elements like the start button and input field are interactively managed based on the game state.

### Code Structure:
- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the typing test, including the display area for the test sentence, the input box, and the start/reset buttons.
- **CSS**: Styles the application, giving it a visually appealing look, and uses animations for elements like the timer.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the game's logic. This includes:
  - Starting and resetting the game
  - Shuffling the sentences
  - Updating the timer and determining when the game ends

## Usage:

1. Load the HTML file in your browser.
2. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
3. Type the sentence displayed above the input box.
4. Try to type as many sentences as possible within 60 seconds.
